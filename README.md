# GitHub Task List Generator

This is a simple Node app which takes the url for a GitHub project column and generates a Markdown-style list of all the cards in the column.

## Installation

- Clone this repository.
- Run `npm install`.

## Running the app

- Simply run `npm start`. This will do a build and then run the script.
- When prompted enter the url of the column you wish to generate the list from (eg `https://github.com/orgs/Automattic/projects/148#column-19656370`).
